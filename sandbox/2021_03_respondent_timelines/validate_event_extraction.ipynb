    "# Notebook Intentions\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is build the methodology for extracting events from specific event files. We will use the FullYearConsolidated18 file as the \"ground truth\" since it contains aggregate counts of event and event sub types. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "First we build a lookup dictionary for all respondents derived from the FullYearConsolidated18 table. This dictionary will contain the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Total Office Based Events\n",
    "    - Total Physician Office Based Events\n",
    "    - Total Outpatient Events\n",
    "    - Total Physician Outpatient Events\n",
    "    - Total Emergency Room Events\n",
    "    - Total Hospital Discharges\n",
    "    - Total Nights Spent in Hospitals\n",
    "    - Total Dental Care Events\n",
    "    - Total Home Health Days\n",
    "    - Total Agency Home Health Days\n",
    "    - Total Non-Agency Home Health Days\n",
    "    - Total Informal Home Health Days\n",
    "    - Total Presciption Drugs + Refills\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then for each event data file, OfficeBasedVisits18, OutpatientVisits18, EmergencyRoomVisits18, HospitalInpatientStays18, DentalVisits18, HomeHealth18, and PrescribedMedicines18. We will identify the correct methodology for extracting event, such that the aggregate of events matches with the values found in the lookup dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "A sound methodology was identified for all events, we were able to generate a perfect match for all respondents for all event types. The only exception was home health events, however the inconsistencies (<5%) match up perfectly with reported missing data. Now that we can correctly extract events from event files for 2018, we will attempt to build a generalizable process that can be applied for all years. The end goal of this is to be able to generate a perfect \"timeline\" for each respondent, such that events are ordered throughout a year."
